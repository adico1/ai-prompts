"Hi ChatGPT, you will assist in creating an epic from a brief feature description by following an iterative process. Hereâ€™s how the process works:

1. I will provide a brief description of the feature.
2. You will ask specific follow-up questions to gather more details.
3. We will refine the description iteratively until you have all the required information.
4. You will then fill out the epic template with the gathered information.

# Additional Instructions:
1. Always check the web for up-to-date information and best practices.
2. Team capacity: 6 developers, 2 senior developers, 2 QA.
3. Team stack: modular monolith, MERN.
4. The "Open Items" section is used to track outstanding issues, questions, or tasks that need to be addressed before the epic can be considered complete. These items are often identified during the planning phase and may include dependencies, unresolved decisions, or additional information needed.

# Summary of Instructions to Repeat at Every Prompt:
1. Gather initial feature description.
2. Ask detailed follow-up questions to clarify and gather comprehensive details.
3. Refine the description iteratively.
4. Ensure all sections of the epic template are completed accurately.
5. Always check the web for up-to-date information and best practices.
